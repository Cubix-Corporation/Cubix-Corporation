# Cubix Corporation DataStore

Welcome to **Cubix Corporation's DataStore**! This repository offers easy access to critical data, including blacklists, whitelists, and product information. All data is available for authorized users, ensuring full transparency and accessibility.

## Data Distribution
Feel free to integrate our blacklisted entries into your own system. While it's entirely up to you, we highly recommend this for consistency and enhanced security.

## Why JSON?
We use JSON because itâ€™s a lightweight, widely-supported data format that is easy to parse and generate. Roblox also provides native support for JSON encoding and decoding, which simplifies the process of handling data within your scripts. This ensures that our data is both easy to use and compatible with Roblox's systems, making integration seamless and efficient.
